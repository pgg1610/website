Data aesthete at heart, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Davidson School of Chemical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) at Purdue University, advised by [Jeffrey P. Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163). Understanding molecular-level behavior of the catalyst through data and science is at the heart of my Ph.D. research. 

I have been fortunate to be involved in multiple collaborations, industry and academia in India and USA, wherein I used data to pursue a narrative thread and unravel a rich tapestry of information to deliver key insights as simple and actionable goals.

Besides research, I love to teach science with focus on improving scientific literacy. Currently I am involved in developing a data science + machine learning crash course for the incoming summer cohort of REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate).

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking [(link to some latest experiments)](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, reading philosophy, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides. 

I maintain a [Data Science blog](https://pgg1610.github.io/blog_fastpages/) where I document tips, code, and helpful resource.
