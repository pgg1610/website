Hello! I am a doctoral candidate in the [Davidson School of Chemical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) at Purdue University, advised by [Jeffrey P. Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163). Data aesthete at heart, understanding the molecular-level behavior of the catalyst through data and science is the main focus of doctoral research.

Besides research, I love to teach and help improving scientific literacy. Presently, I am involved in developing a data science & machine learning crash course for the summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate) cohort. 

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking [(link to some latest experiments)](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, reading philosophy, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides. 

I maintain a [Data Science blog](https://pgg1610.github.io/blog_fastpages/) where I document my thoughts, notebooks, tips, and list of helpful resources.
