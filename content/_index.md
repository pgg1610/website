Data aesthete at heart, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Davidson School of Chemical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163). My research focus is investigation of catalyst morphology and modeling complex reaction pathways using a combination of first-principles based quantum-chemical methods and machine-learning. 

Currently, I am part of a cross-disciplinary team involved in identification of in-situ mechanisms for degradation and transformation of electro-catalysts; the impact these transformations have on the catalytic activity. The primary focus of this project is on energy-critical oxygen-cycle electrocatalytic reactions to develop sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel resoruces for meeting future energy demands. 

In addition, I am part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) - an engineering research center, working on developing a free, web-based tool for evaluating the hazards and safety involved in a university-scale laboratory. This effort is supported by NSF as part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) consortium and jointly supervised by [Purdue Process Safety and Assurance Center (P2SAC)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/P2SAC)

Besides research, I am passionate about [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), long-distance running, biking, and playing video games. I tweet my thoughts and interesting articles I find on the internet at [@mepgg](https://twitter.com/mepgg)
