Data aesthete at heart, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Davidson School of Chemical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163). 

>**Understanding molecular-level behavior of the catalyst is at the heart of my Ph.D. research.** 

Working in close collaboration with experimentalists, at [Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~catalyst/) and beyond,  I develop atomic-scale computational models through a combination of _chemistry, physics, data science, and machine-learning_ that capture the essential structure-function properties of the real-world catalyst. These models are used to identify physical/chemical transformations of the catalysts; the impact these transformations have on their catalytic activity, and propose design principles governing the performance of the catalyst. The primary focus of my work is on improving fuel-cell technologies to develop sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel resources for meeting future energy demands.

In addition, I am part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) - an engineering research center, working on developing a free web-based tool to estimate, analyze, and compile the hazards associated with setting up a lab-scale chemical reaction. This effort is supported by NSF as part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) consortium and jointly supervised by [Purdue Process Safety and Assurance Center (P2SAC)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/P2SAC)

Besides research, I am passionate about cooking, experimenting with different tastes and textures [(link to some latest experiments)](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/); love to go down internet rabbit holes, and enjoy long bike rides.
