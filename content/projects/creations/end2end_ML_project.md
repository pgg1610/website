This project is adapted from Aurelien Geron's Hands-on Machine Learning Book [(github link)](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2). We build a regression model to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts. More importantly, this project go through the basic building blocks when setting up any ML projects. 

Following are main steps to consider: 
* Formulating the problem, defining the boundary conditions
* Data acquisition
* Discover and visualize data / Data exploration to gain insight
* Prepare data for ML algorithm training and testing
* Explore various model architectures to use
* Select model and train it
* Fine-tuning the model
