This project is obtained from Aurelien Geron's Hands-on Machine Leanring with Scikit-learn and Tensorflow [(github link)](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2). The aim to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.

Main steps we will go through:
* Formulate the problem
* Get the data
* Discover and visualize data / Data exploration to gain insight
* Prep data for ML algorithm testing
* Select model and train it
* Fine-tuning the model
