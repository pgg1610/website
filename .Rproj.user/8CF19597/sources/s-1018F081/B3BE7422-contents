title: Bayesian Optimization using Gaussian Processes
---
* Notebook explaining the idea behind bayesian optimization alongside a small example showing its use. This notebook was adapted from Martin Krasser's [blogpost](http://krasserm.github.io/2018/03/21/bayesian-optimization/)
* Good introductory write-up on Bayesian optimization [here](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/)
* Nice lecture explaining the working of Gaussian Processes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92-98SYOdlY&t=4827s)
