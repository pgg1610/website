title: Indian spices network analysis
---

Indian food, like most of the food from the tropical region, uses a variety of different spices. Historically, the spices are thought to have been a way to increase the shelf-life and keep pests away. Anyways, if you are planning to cook more Indian food lately, it would be great to know which spices would give you most bang for your buck. More so, which spices are often used together? What is the relation between each of them? 

Recently I found a dataset from Kaggle which tabulated 6000+ recipes from https://www.archanaskitchen.com/. Using this data as base collection of recipes representing most of the indian food, I analyze which spices occur most freqeuntly and which spices are most connected to each other. 

* Dataset for Indian recipe: This dataset 6000+ recipe scrapped from: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kanishk307/6000-indian-food-recipes-dataset)
