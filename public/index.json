[{"categories":null,"contents":"Synopsis: In the past several years, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board has found an increase in the frequency of laboratory accidents and injuries. A framework to document, assess, and mitigate hazards is a critical starting point for ensuring safe laboratory practices. To address this requirement, I was part of a team working on developing Reactive Hazards Evaluation Analysis and Compilation Tool (RHEACT), an online platform to compile and scrutinize hazards-related information, was developed. This work was jointly supported by the CISTAR consortium and the Purdue Process Safety and Assurance Center (P2SAC)\nWhen planning an experiment, the researchers provide RHEACT: (1) information about the chemicals involved in the reaction, in the form of Safety Data Sheets (SDS), and (2) operating parameters of the reaction. Through the user-supplied SDS, an operational hazard matrix and a chemical compatibility matrix are generated. In addition, adiabatic temperature rise of the reaction is estimated to ensure that the chemistry is within user-controlled bounds. The user is provided with a broad initial evaluation of potential hazards and is notified of safety concerns associated with the reaction before conducting the experiment.\nDuring the development of the tool, I was involved in following tasks:\n Develop the PDF parser that will read, extract, and store relevant chemical information from material safety datasheets (MSDS) Build front-end GUI using React Build web automation routine for generating chemical compatibility matrix using Selenium.

In some cases, the interface between the metal and the supporting oxide is theorized to exhibit unique reactivity compared to just the metal or the oxide in isolation.\nWater-Gas Shift reaction (WGSR) is one such reaction which is expected to show sensitivity to such metal/oxide interfaces. We investigate WGSR with Pt nanoparticles supported MgO as a model system, to understand how the reaction proceed at these interfacial sites.\nKey takewaways:   The interfacial region greatly accelerate the water dissociation step which has an exceedingly high barrier on just the metal (Pt) or oxide (MgO) in isolation.\n  Partial poisoning of CO on the metal affects the over mechanism and it is important the model considers the effect explicitly\n  When developing reaction network schemes for multi-components systems the morphology of active site plays a crucial role with far-reaching consequences.\n  ","permalink":"/publications/ptmgo/","tags":["Kinetic modeling","Catalyst active-site design","DFT","Experimental Collaboration"],"title":"Catalysis at Metal/Oxide Interfaces: Water Gas Shift at Pt/MgO Boundaries"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Synopsis: Combination of experimental kinetics, state-of-the-art characterisation techiques and computation catalyst models to investigate the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Through combined experiment/theory effort these performance and stability changes can be explained by perturbation in the electronic and structural properties of the alloys.\n","permalink":"/publications/pt3v/","tags":["Catalyst active-site design","DFT","Experimental Collaboration"],"title":"Electronic and Structural modification of Pt-V alloy and its consequences for Propane Dehydrogenation Catalysis"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JSON\u0026#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026#34;contents\u0026#34;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
