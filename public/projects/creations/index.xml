      <description>This project is adapted from Aurelien Geron&amp;rsquo;s Hands-on Machine Learning Book (github link). We build a regression model to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts. More importantly, this project go through the basic building blocks when setting up any ML projects.
Following are main steps to consider:
 Formulating the problem, defining the boundary conditions Data acquisition Discover and visualize data / Data exploration to gain insight Prepare data for ML algorithm training and testing Explore various model architectures to use Select model and train it Fine-tuning the model  </description>

      <description>Indian food, like most of the food from the tropical region, uses a variety of different spices. Historically, the spices are thought to have been a way to increase the shelf-life and keep pests away. Anyways, if you are planning to cook more Indian food lately, it would be great to know which spices would give you most bang for your buck. More so, which spices are often used together? What is the relation between each of them?</description>

      <description>Convolutional neural network is used to train on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.
What does it consists of? The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.</description>
