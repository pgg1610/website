      <description>Simple example to illustrate the utility and working of graph neural networks.
A natural way to represent information in a structured form is as a graph. A graph is a data structure describing a collection of entities, represented as nodes, and their pairwise relationships, represented as edges. Think of it as a mathematical abstraction to present relational data.
Graphs are everywhere: social networks, the world wide web, street maps, knowledge bases used in search engines, and even chemical molecules are frequently represented as a set of entities and relations between them.</description>
