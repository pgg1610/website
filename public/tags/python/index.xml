      <description>BOSH (Bosh Outer SHell) &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;is an open source tool for release engineering, deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.&amp;rdquo; And it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly powerful. This examples uses BOSH to provision an Alassian vendor app running on JDK along with the support Postgres database and agents to support it. The releases manages the health of services and will automatically provision, start/stop processes across the various services.</description>

      <description>This project is obtained from Aurelien Geron&amp;rsquo;s Hands-on Machine Leanring with Scikit-learn and Tensorflow (github link). The aim to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.
Main steps we will go through:
 Formulate the problem Get the data Discover and visualize data / Data exploration to gain insight Prep data for ML algorithm testing Select model and train it Fine-tuning the model  </description>

      <description>Convolutional neural network is used to train on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.
What does it consists of? The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.</description>
