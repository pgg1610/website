      <description>Simple example to illustrate the utility and working of graph neural networks.
A natural way to represent information in a structured form is as a graph. A graph is a data structure describing a collection of entities, represented as nodes, and their pairwise relationships, represented as edges. Think of it as a mathematical abstraction to present relational data.
Graphs are everywhere: social networks, the world wide web, street maps, knowledge bases used in search engines, and even chemical molecules are frequently represented as a set of entities and relations between them.</description>

      <description>Simple dropout to implement uncertainty estimates: Bayesian Neural Networks  Adapted from Deep Learning online course notes from NYU. Note link Paper about using Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation  Another notebook which uses PyTorch dropout: Link
  Review article on application of uncertainty-quantification for small-molecule property prediction
  New paper on evidential deep learning
  In addition to predicting a value from a model it is also important to know the confidence in that prediction.</description>

      <description>Convolutional neural network is used to train on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.
What does it consists of? The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.</description>
