      <description>This tutorial is adapted from Jake VanderPlas&amp;rsquo;s example of SVM as given in his reference book: Python Data Science Handbook
Motivation for Support Vector Machines We want to find a line/curve (in 2D) or a manifold (in n-D) that divides the class from each other. This is a type of Discriminative Classification
Consider a simple case of classification task, in which the two classes of points are well separated. We can find region in space which best separates the data into two classes.</description>
