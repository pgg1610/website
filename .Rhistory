My graduate research revolves around building multi-scale catalyst models that capture the essential structure-functional properties of the real-world catalyst through a combination of first-principles based modeling algorithms and deep learning; investigating design rules enabling the prediction and synthesis of next-generation (electro)catalysts.
In addition, I am part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) - an engineering research center, working on developing a open-source web-based tool for evaluating the hazards and safety involved in a university-scale laboratory. This effort is supported by NSF as part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) consortium and jointly supervised by [Purdue Process Safety and Assurance Center (P2SAC)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/P2SAC)
